Copy your dota keybinds and settings from one steam account to another.

- notes, if you have never launched dota on your alt account, launch it before doing this process -

IMPORTANT: Close dota before starting these steps

1) Open DKC.exe
2) Click "Steam DIR" button & select your steam install path (often C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam)
3) Open dota on your main account and find your friend Id. This is displayed on your in-game profile.
4) Select that friend id in the combo box. (This is the account that you are sourcing your keybinds from)
5) Repeat steps 3-4 for the second combobox & select your ALT account
6) Click "Copy Keybinds"




# Importing & Exporting
In version 1.0.1, importing and exporting was added. This works off your Main account. 

After completing step 4, you can click "Export" and your dota settings will be saved into the same directory as DKC.exe
You can back this up, send it to friends, or use this on another machine. 

To import, simply complete step 4 and click "Import". Select your exporting settings & you are done!

Note, both of these features require you to have already launched dota under the account you are importing or exporting.
