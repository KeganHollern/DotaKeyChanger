Automatically copy your dota keybinds and settings from one steam account to another.

## Automatic Keybind Transfer

To transfer keybinds, you must set the source keybind set. This is done by logging in to your main steam account and clicking "Set Primary Keybinds".

After this step, keybinds will automatically transfer to any steam account you log in to. This transfer happens 5 seconds after login. 

If keybinds do not automatically transfer, you can manually transfer them. Close Dota and click "Transfer Keybinds" to set your current keybinds to the Primary Set.

## Keybind Backups

You can create backups for your individual accounts keybinds. This protects you from accidentally overwriting keybinds that you wanted to save. 

Click "Backup" to create a backup. This step is automatically done when setting your Primary Keybinds. 

Click "Restore" to restore from a backup. Restore is only available if a backup has been created.
